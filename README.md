## Run code on Binder:

## To run code locally:
It is recommended to have an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment set up. Anaconda is a package manager and a useful data science platform. For instructions on how to install please visit:
  - For Mac OS: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/
  - For Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

Once you have a Python environment, you may work directly with a copy of the notebooks, using these three files:
  - [notebook_name].ipynb, the notebook itself
  - requirements.txt, a list of Python modules required to run the code
  - jupyter_notebook_config.py, a Python file with some configuration settings
 or in other words, by downloading the files in one of the notebook folders.

If youâ€™re on a Mac, you may follow these steps to install:
  1) Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory with the files.
  2) To install all the required Python modules, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3) Launch Jupyter Notebook locally with: `jupyter notebook`

To shut down the notebook, type Control-C in the terminal window.
